Commit messages
---------------

The first rule is _keep it as short and simple as possible_.

Summarize the main objective of the commit in one line.
If a longer description is necessary, leave a blanck between the summary line and the description.
Synthesize! You may explain the solution to fix an issue, a specific reason to provide a feature that was not available before, and so on.


### Types of commits

Commits can be made for different goals, e.g., organizing the repository or fix a bug.
To enhance the readability of the commit messages, they are organized in several categories.

All commit summary line should start if one of the keyword listed in the table below, sorted alphabetically.

| KEYWORD	| Description |
| :-----:	| :---------- |
| `FIX`		| Fixes a bug or an opened issue. |
| `REPO`	| Organizes the repository. |


### Template for commit message

A typical commit message is:
```
KEYWORD one-word goal: summary

Long description 
(if necessary).
```


### Examples

A one-line commit for adding a license:
```
REPO license: ECL v2.0
```
